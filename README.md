## Inspiration for Insight
- Prompt for this week's Hackathon was to empower learning so we decided to come up with a platform where we can help underprivileged and people who like retired professor that wanna teach to come together 
- As a personal experience when we went out to teach the underprivileged through NGO we realised that these kids needed time and proper teachers to clear basic concepts

## What is Insight 
-  It is a platform where retired professors and teachers or anybody who wanna teach anything can come, make videos and get a community together 
- The vision is to make education available to everyone , as well as engage retired teachers such that these teachers can continue their noble through a medium that can provide education to the underprivileged and that to in any part of the 
- Further this application is not limited to children only , underprivileged adults can also take advantage of it .After all one can never learn everything as what we know is a drop of water in a big ocean

## How We Built It
- We started by creating the flowchart of the project to setup the flow of the project and divide the work between us
- Frontend was made by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to make it look responsive and attractive
-  Backend was made by using a python module Django and authentication was done using Django-Auth

## Challenges We Ran Into
- There were obviously CSS Bugs like any other project. Also we faced problem using django like every project
