# ULhacks


## Inspiration
The team brainstormed on how to make an impactful solution to some of the issues of education presently using tech and then we came up with *A debating platform where in a hot topic is released and that start of the week .*...we believe the conventional style of learning isn't really going to be the conventional style of learning in future.

The application is aimed at empowering learning as well as enhancing one's debating skills

## What it does
 It allows people tweet opinions about a hot topic it in form of short texts(140 to 280 characters).
Then through the week people can upvote or downvote a particular opinion (either for / against the topic).
The topic that gets the most upvotes get featured (on the main spaces of the web app or any other space)

## How we built it
We used Html, Css, JavaScript, Firebase, and Django in building our application

## What's next for InSight
We are glad to take our project to it's first version and stoked to see what improvements we can make
